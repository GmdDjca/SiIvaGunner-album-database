This is some kind of database I'm building for a command for my bot, Hitomi Manaka#4825, which will include a list of all SiIvaGunner albums and it will also allow you to see their descriptions and mega/bandcamp/drive links and everything.

Sounds cool, right? Thanks hehe

You're free to contribute too, as I'm laaaaaaaaaazy as hell (and I have a limited time for stuff like this). Any help is well recieved!

What? You want to see the bot? Sure! Here's a link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=431495393520386068&scope=bot&permissions=8

Wait, you actually didn't asked for it? Aw, man...

Anyways, if you want to contribute, please follow the format followed in the albums that are already made. If a MP3/FLAC MEGA or Drive link is missing or there are more formats avaiable (like OGG), don't doubt on removing/adding it to the arrays for the album download links. If there is more than one link for the same file format, like in the album nยบ03, add these too.

Please read the repo description.
